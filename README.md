Excel Structural Analysis Package

This is a mostly complete, i.e. sans real testing, 2D frame analysis
written in Excel with a VBA backend. 

There may be some problems with the error checking that was
implmented, user input type checking mostly. It was one of the last
things I was working on and can't remember if I completed the testing.

It has a robust solution routine with an LU decomposition with partial
pivoting written natively in VBA. It allows for rapid solution of 
multiple load cases. The code is written in an OOP style, or as close
as you can get in VBA. 

There were plans to include many additional features but I really 
don't like writing VBA or using Excel. There are places in the code
to include shear deflection of the beam elements for 2D frames, truss
elements, and 3D beam elements.

I seriously doubt that I will be working on this in the future. If 
someone paid me a respectable amount and it would remain open 
source I would consider finishing it because it is kinda cool I 
in a "You made Excel do what?!" kind of way.
